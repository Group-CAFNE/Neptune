# Neptune - An Intermediate Language for Music Composition on the Commodore 64

Neptune is an intermediate language designed to bridge the gap between high-level programming and direct interaction with the Commodore 64 and its iconic SID chip. It provides a more accessible way to harness the power of this classic machine.

This project was created as part of a fourth-semester semester project at Aalborg University (Copenhagen). Our task was to develop a compiler, and we chose to translate a custom music language into 6502 assembly code. This assembly code can then be executed on the Commodore 64, allowing it to utilize the SID 6581 sound chip to produce authentic 8-bit chiptune music.

Curious to learn more? You can access the complete project report [here](https://github.com/P4-Group/Neptune-Report/blob/main/SW4_Group_8.pdf).

## Features

- Clear Error reporting: Provides line and char number if errors occur.
- 6502 Assembli Compliation: Translate Neptune code into 6502 Assembly ready
- dasm Integration: Integrates with the dasm assembler for easy generation of .prg files for the Commodore 64.
- High-Level Music Language: intuitive and expressive if need be.
- SID Chip Control: Gives simplified control over the Commodore 64's SID Sound chip.



## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

This project relies on the following:

* **OCaml**: Version 4.07.0 or newer.
* **MenhirLib**: Any version.
* **Dune**: Version 3.17 or newer.

For full functionality, you'll also need:

* **dasm**: Ensure the `dasm` executable is in the compilers PATH.

### Compiling the Project

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone hhttps://github.com/P4-Group/Neptune
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Neptune
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  opam install dune &
  opam install MenhirLib
```

Build the project

```bash
  dune build
```

An executable will be generated in "_build/default/bin/"

### Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  dune runtest
```


### Command-Line Usage

The Neptune compiler is a command-line tool. You **must** provide a source file, and you can add optional flags to modify its behavior.

```bash
./Neptune -s <source_file> [OPTIONS]
```

#### Essential Usage

**Specify Your Source File:** The core of using this compiler is telling it which file to process. You do this with the `-s` flag, followed by the path to your source file.

Example: 
```bash
./Neptune -s my_project/song.nptn
```

#### Optional Flags

These flags can be added individually or combined to get different outputs or behaviors:

| **Flag** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| `-dasm` | Enable the use of DASM to assemble output. Requires the DASM executable to be available in your system's PATH. |
| `-tgt-ast` | Display the Target Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that the compiler generates. |
| `-src-ast` | Display the Source Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) as parsed from your input file. |
| `-sym-tab` | Print the compiler's Symbol Table, showing defined symbols and their properties. |
| `-debug` | Turn on debug mode for more detailed output that can help with troubleshooting. |
| `-h` | Show a help message with all available options and exit. |

#### Examples

**Basic Compilation:**
```bash
./Neptune -s song.nptn
```

**Compile and view Source AST:**
```bash
./Neptune -s chiptune.nptn -src-ast
```

**Full debugging with DASM and Symbol Table:**
```bash
./Neptune -s complex_song.nptn -dasm -sym-tab -debug
```


## Code Snippet Samples

More code snippets can be seen in [success tests](https://github.com/P4-Group/Neptune/tree/main/tests/succes).

#### Incy Wincy Spider
```
tempo = 300
timeSignature = (4,4)
standardPitch = 440

sequence seq1 = { c:4:5 c:4:5 c:4:5 d:4:5 e:4:5 e:4:5 e:2:5 d:4:5 d:4:5 d:4:5 e:4:5 c:2:5 c:2:5 }
sequence seq2 = { a:4:1 a:4:1 a:4:1 b:4:1 c:4:2 c:4:2 c:2:2 b:4:1 b:4:1 b:4:1 c:4:2 a:2:1 a:2:1 }
sequence seq3 = { c:4:3 c:4:3 c:4:3 d:4:3 e:4:3 e:4:3 e:2:3 d:4:3 d:4:3 d:4:3 e:4:3 c:2:3 c:2:3 }

voice1 = [(seq1, vPulse), (seq1, sawtooth)]
voice2 = [(seq2, vPulse), (seq2, sawtooth)]
voice3 = [(seq3, vPulse), (seq3, sawtooth)]
```

## Playing the Music

Once you've compiled your Neptune code, you'll have a .prg file (e.g., song.prg) in your project directory. This file contains the 6502 assembly code that the Commodore 64 understands. To hear your music, you'll need a Commodore 64 emulator or actual Commodore 64 hardware.

### Using an Emulator (Recommended: Vice)

We highly recommend using the **Vice** emulator. Here's how to load and play your .prg file:


1.  **Generate your .prg file:** Compile your Neptune source file with the -dasm flag:

    ./Neptune -s your_song.nptn -dasm

    This will create your_song.prg in your current directory.

2.  **Launch Vice:** Start the Vice emulator on your system.

3.  **Load the program:**
    * Go to File > Autostart disk/tape image...
    * Navigate to where your your_song.prg file is saved and select it.

Vice will automatically load and run the program, and you should hear your sweet Nep**tunes**!

(Do note to use the original emulated SID 6581 chip, you do need to change your audio settings inside Vice and set it to "6581")
